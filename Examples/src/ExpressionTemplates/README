Two examples oof use of expression templates

Algebra. a class of vectors where algebraic operation are optimized by using expression templates
Integral: an example of quadrature rule made more efficient by expression templates. Note however that they are "static", less flexible and general
  the classes in QuadratureRule 

Note: remember that you may gain efficiency with expression template only if you compile with optimization!

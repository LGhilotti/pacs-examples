A simple test of forward error analysis for the computation of the derivative of a function via centered finite differences.
It shows the relevance of the truncation error as the step h gets smaller

make run runs the test

The file data.pot may change some of the parameters

NEW VERSION: it computes the derivative also with the special formula that does
not takes differences, so it is not subject to cancellation errors

A few utilities that simplifies composition with polymorfic object.

A first utility checks if a class has the clone() method. It uses some
interesting metaprogramming techniques. It is complemented by a simple
static predicate, isClonable, that returns trur is the tempalte
argument is of a clonable class.

The second class defines a pointer-like object that performs deep copy of the
(polymorphic) resource by means of the method clone().

The third allows to create clonable classes by inheritance. It uses
the CRTP paradigm.

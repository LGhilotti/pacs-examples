//! An example of abstract builder base class
/*!
  It forms the base for builders to be used with 
  object factories.

  It uses the default constructor. It would be nice to have
  a generic builder able to pass also arguments to the constructor.

  However it is veri difficult to build a generic one of that sort. Of
  course for a specific hyerarchy of classes you may construct a
  specific builder that hase several create() methods each taking
  different arguments, to be paseed to the constructor.

  Unfortunately, template methods cannot be virtual, otherwise the solution
  would be simple indeed!

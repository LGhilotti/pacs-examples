An example of use of reference wrappers.

First we show the use of std::ref() to be able to pass a reference to a function instantiated from a template of the form

template <class T>
double fun(T x);

There is no way pass by reference unless you use std::ref() or std::cref()

Then we show the use of reference_wrapper<T> to store objects that behaves as reference in a std::vector<> (I recall that you cannot store references
in a vector<T> directly).

A very simple example that explain virtual inheritance.

Class D inherits from C and B, which have both a common base, class A.

If we do not derive virtually we have duplication of the variable
members of A, which is probably not what we wanted.

Thry to see the difference between virtual and normal inheritance by changing

class B: virtual public A{

in

class B: public A{

and the same for class C.


*Suggestion: avoid this type of situations!

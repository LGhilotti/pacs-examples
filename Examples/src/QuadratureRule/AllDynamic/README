Dynamic loading of numerical rules and integrands:
go in ../baseversion and do

make dynamic
make install

go in ../generic_factory
and do

make install

(you have also to install ./AbstractFactory ./RK45 ./Utility and ./OneDMesh)

Data read from quadratura.getpot (a getpot file)

To compile the libraries
make dynamic [DEBUG=no]

to compile the executable

make exec [DEBUG=no]

library load binding is local unless DEBUG=no is indicated **changed since
AA 18-19, now library binding is made also to libraries in
$(PACS_LIB_DIR), to simplify things

if you use the macro DEBUG=no (es: make exec DEBUG=no)
you compile with -O3 


The linking is always made against libraries in Examples/lib a part
for the local library used to register rules in the factory and the
library with the integrands.

  @briefThis is an example of class hierarchy that
  represents poligonal object.

  @detail This module is wrapped in the namespace `Geometry`. It
  represent a first example of class hyerarchy with public
  inheritance. The class `AbstractPolygon` defines the general public
  interface of all other classes representing polygonal objects.
  
  We make use of some syntax of the C++11 new standard so you need to
  compile with *-std=c++0x* or (since gcc 4.7) *-std=c++11*

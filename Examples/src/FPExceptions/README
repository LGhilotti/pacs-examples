This directory contains two utilities

trapfpe.hpp a header only utility that you should include in your main
            source file if you want to be able to activate "abort on
            major fp exceptions".  To activate this feature you have
            to compile your code with the cpp option -DFPE_ABORT. If
            not nothing happens and you have the default behaviour in
            case of floating point exceptions.  With major floating
            point exceptions I mean: invalid operation, divide by
            zero, overflow.

fpeUtilities.[hc]pp a little library that introduces some exception
                    classes inherited from std::runtime_error and a
                    function that tests if major fp exception has been
                    raised and in that case launches the relevant
                    exception, or returns a boolean equal to true.

A test is available, main_fpe.cpp, to test the utilities.

TO COMPILE

make static; make exec  // make static lib and executable


make dynamic; make exec // make dynamic lib and executable

make exec; // make just the executable

If you specify FPE_ABORT=yes, for instance make exec FPE_ABORT=yes you
are activating "abort on fpe" in the test example.

make install to install in the correct directory all headers and library
libfpe.a/so containing the compiled fpe Utility, for use in other
examples.

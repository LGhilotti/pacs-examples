CooExtractor.hpp
 	It allows to create a sparse matrix which is basically of the form of a vector of indexex (ij) and the corresponding values.
 	We have utilities to write the matrix in this format in Octave format or convert it to a sparse eigen matrix
 	Additional utilities allows to write an eigen matrix in a format readable by Octave/Matlab format.
 
 MM_readers
 	Utilities fo read matrices in Matrix Market format into Eigen. Matrix Market format is a format widely used to store sparse matrices,
 	Search Matrix Market on the web for documentation. A Note: Eigen has its own readers for matrix market. I wrote this utility because
 	native Eigen utilities were not well written. But since version 3.4 things are evolving and the interfeces for matrix market marix of
 	Eigen is getting better. Maybe that in a next release the functions contained in this file will be obsolete and one should use
 	the ones provided by Eigen directly.
 	
RotatingVector
	A class that implements an array that stores only the last N entries added (perhaps the name is not very appropriate, 
	we are not rotating anything). The array has N element and the insertion of a N+1 element will cause the first element to be discarded,
	all the elemenets shifted by one to the left and the new element added at the back of the RotatingVector.
	
Thomas
	Implementation of the Thomas algorithm for tridiagonal matices. It contains also a version for systems where symmetry conditions
	are imposed!
	
Utility
	An utility to extract the graph os a matrix and another utility to apply symmetric permutation on a Eigen sparse matrix. We have also 
	an utility to apply RCMK reordering of a matrix.

Here we have the routines of the IML++ Library converted to be used with the eigen. You nedd to install the Utilities

Go into ../Utilities and type

make install

In testings you find several tests

in ../MatrixData you have several matrices to test.

TODO: I need to put all utilities in the namespace LinearAlgebra and make traits real traits. It takes some time so 
I am postponing this.

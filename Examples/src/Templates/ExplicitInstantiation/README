An example about explicit instantiation of templates. Explicit instantiation allows to precompile instances of class templates
for values of the template parameter that are considered most common. 

In general the object code containing the instances is then stored in a library.
called libmylib.so

If you use nm --demangle you may note that it stores the symbold for
all the classes/functions that have been explicitely
instantiated. Those symbols will be loaded into your code at linking
stage, avoiding useless recompilations of function/class templates
used very often.

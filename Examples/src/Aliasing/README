An example of argument aliasing. 

The implemantation of an aliasing safe function, like fun2, is normally less efficient and/or uses up more memory. So, often to increase efficiency
one makes functions which are not alias safe, that is they would return a wrong result if an argument is repeated.

Nothing wrong with it, but beware!

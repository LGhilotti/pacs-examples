This example shows the usage of the random distribution utilities available in the Standard library.
The file main_random produces a set of samples generated with different distributions. It shows a poor man histogram of each distribution on the screen but also 
some files with extension .dat with the values produces by each distibution. The number of samples may be changed by setting the constexpt variable N in the source file.

This directory contains also an utility, calles main_writeDensityFunction that reads a file generated by main_random and produses an other file called with the same name with the 
addition of _dist, and which contains the empirical density function computed from the values. 

You can use gnuplot (or any other tool) to plot these latter files. The gnuplot command is simply (filename being the name of the file)

gnuplot> plot "filename" using 1:2 

for plotting the PDF or 

gnuplot> plot "filename" using 1:3 

for plotting the cumulative probability

Note that the plot of the empirical PDF is very noisy. A filtering
will be required. Cumulative probability, being instead an integral,
is smoother.

Also the files with the raw data produced by main_random may be seen
with gnuplol. You only need to skip the first line, which contains the
number of samples.  You can use this trick, at the glupolt prompt

gnuplot> set key autotitle columnhead
gnuplot> plot "filename" w p title "samples"

Or

gnuplot>plot "filename"  every ::1

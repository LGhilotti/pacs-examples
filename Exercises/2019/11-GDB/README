Example of debugging.

The program 'integer-list' in the directory 'buggy' has:

1) One compile error
2) One run-time error
3) One memory leak
4) A potential memory leak that is not captured in the main

find all the issues and fix them.
The directory 'fixed' contains the fixed code,
please don't look at it before trying to solve
the exercise yourself.
